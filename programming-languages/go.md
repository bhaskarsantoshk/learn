# Go

# Intro:

- Go is a statically typed and compiled programming language.
- Statically typed : The variables are explicitly typed and determined at compile time.
- Compiled language: A language that translates source code to machine code before execution.
- C++ has fast execution but slow and inefficient building , Java and .NET compile fast but have slow execution, Python/Ruby/JS are easy to write but are slower in exution. Go combines best of all : Efficent and fast compilation, Fast execution and easy to program.
- Go with the concept of Goroutines make the best use of multi core and multi processor computers.
- Go has better Memory Mangement.
- Go, in general, has only one way of getting a particular operation done - so, It’s easy to read other people’s code.
- Go doesn’t have operator oveloading.
